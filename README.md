I’m passionate about cybersecurity because I believe in protecting people, organizations, and data from ever-evolving digital threats. With a strong foundation in compliance and a growing knowledge of security principles, I’m driven to contribute to a safer, more secure digital world. I’m continuously learning and eager to bring both technical curiosity and a strong sense of responsibility to the cybersecurity field.
